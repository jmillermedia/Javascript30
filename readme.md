# #Javascript30:
30 Day Vanilla JavaScript Coding Challenge: 30 Days, 30 Projects, Vanilla JavaScript with minor HTML & CSS.

Read branch commit notes on GitHub for any addtions and/or from the lesson.

## Resources:
Main repo assets, README.MD banner, and course instruction taken from: [Javascript 30 days, 30 pages challenge.](https://javascript30.com/ 'JavaScript30.com')

## Who is this For? (from the site):
Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library.

You should already know some JavaScript to start - This isn't a JavaScript 101 course. We learn by application - encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them.

We steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These things are great and often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.

These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page. If you are stuck in console.log() land, these videos are your next step. Oh, the stuff we build is really fun!
